# Theory-of-Computation-and-Compiler-Design
This repo contains implementations of key concepts from the Theory of Computation and Compiler Design. It includes programs for code optimization, code generation for stack machines, and regular expression to DFA conversion. Helpful in demonstrating practical applications of compiler design techniques, automata theory, and string processing.
